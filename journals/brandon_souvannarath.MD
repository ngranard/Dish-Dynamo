## Journals

Please keep all of your individual journals in this directory.

Each team member is required to keep a development journal, which should be a single markdown file with an entry for each day the project was worked on.

Recommended naming convention is `first_last.md`.

Today, I worked on:

- Authentication

The team needed to finish up more of authentication. We needed to get our login, logout, and sign up to work. We had a lot of trouble with sign up, having it become one of our blockers for the day. We reached out in the help me understand channel and received help from Jon and Lindsey, but still were unable to fix our issues. Getting burnt out and going into the weekend, we decided to push this blocker to the next week.

Today, I worked on:

- Authentication

The team worked on the authentication using the exploration to guide us. We had some trouble getting the FastAPI web servers to work but eventually were able to get through things and get it up and running. We were able to get that started but still need to do the rest tomorrow.
