## April 28

Today I worked on:

- Added redirect to user recipes page when user submits a newly created recipe
- Added a button on my Recipe card to edit recipe
- Finish creating README and updated screenshots of wireframe

## April 27

Today I worked on:

- Finishing up the read me, documenting GHI and fixing some screenshots
- On the front end: if user has no recipes, shows image of sad toast and a link to redirect to create recipe page

## April 26

Today I worked on:

- Starting the ReadME, screenshots of API, and Wireframes
- Attempted to solve login error on the front end, we were experiencing a problem where if user does not provide valid credentials for login no error message is displayed and log in is always undefined. Decided to push it to a stretch goal

Key take aways:

- Get a good grasp of documentation on Auth, as a group tried to troubleshoot but could have saved time by understanding what was going on under the hood instead

## April 24

Today I worked on:

- More front end styling

## April 20:

Today I worked on:

- Worked on creating and testing unit tests for ingredients
- Login Form

## April 19:

Today I worked on:

- Attaching recipe to the user. Lindsey gave us some advice
- Getting deploying to work
- Login form

Key take aways:

- Ingredients in a recipe need to be assigned a foreign key/id that responds to that id to list out ingredients
- Have no 0 days, force yourself to do it, try to figure out a way to get paid for learning, applying is a numbers game and become numb to rejection

## April 18:

Today I worked on:

- Figuring out the DATABASE_URL for our CI/CD
- Continued to troubleshoot and wrap up deployment
- Touched upon early version of main page
- Researched search logic, possible auto complete?

Key take aways:

- For search logic try to create a route that accepts user ingredient list as an input then run SQL aquery to find matching recipes then return results in format that can be displayed with ChakraUI

## April 17:

Today I worked on:

- Fixing the create an ingredient endpoint, made a merge request then pushed to main
- As a group set up our CapRover for deployment
- Trying to fix pipeline failures

## April 6:

Today I worked on:

- We helped each other debug CRUD operations on endpoints
- Front End Authorization upon approval merge of our endpoints

Key take aways:

- Getting another pair of eyes to review code is especially helpful when debugging

## April 5:

Today I worked on:

- Assigning more issues
- Continued working on CRUD for ingredients endpoint
- Touched a bit on front end auth as a group

## April 4:

Today I worked on:

- Finishing up our auth, we can sign up, login and get the user token if the user is logged in
- Focusing on our backend endpoints, I worked on CRUD operations for ingredient endpoints
- Working on merge request

Key take aways:

- Merge requests ensure our quality of code is good and allows for continuous intergration

## April 3:

Today I worked on:

- Continuing to figure out Auth as a group getting the rest of the endpoints
- Got help from SEIRS regarding blocker of getting error in hashed password and account password

Key take aways:

- The importance of indentation as we spent quite some time debugging only to find out it was a simple fix
- Really understanding the documentation and what it does. We spent time looking through the JwtDown documentation
- Console logging when debugging is our bestfriend, we learned how to pinpoint and catch errors from its root by doing so

## March 30

Today we worked on:

- Continuing to work on authorization endopints and user table migrations
- Getting User Token after we sign in
- Proceed with testing login and logout

## March 29

Today I worked on:

- Creating and finalizing and distribution of issues
- User tables to start getting authentication done
- Collaborated on authentication branch using live share, we want users to be able to sign up, sign in, and sign out
- Finalizing Data Schema and API endpoints
- Strengthening understanding of FastAPI
- Rewatched instructional videos to better implement authorization

Key take aways:

- Browser cookies are our end goal in terms of authorization

## March 28

Today I worked on:

- Creating Issues on GitLab regarding the front end and back end
- Discuss what needs to be prioritized in terms of MVP and Stretch goals when creating issues

Key take aways:

- Creating issues benefits us by allowing us to organize and track what needs to be done
- Issues helps keep accountability while also show us all the progress we've made

## March 27

Today I worked on:

- Researching possible component library called ChakraUI to build out our web application
- Doing a practice project code along using ChakraUI to familiarize myself and get an idea of how to incorporate it into the project

Key take aways:

- Beautiful application design is attainable without the need to sacrifice time, performance, and flexibility

## March 24

Today I worked on:

- Wireframing and MVP discussion

Initial planning phase for our web application. As a team we discussed what our Minimum Viable Product should be. We agreed upon implementing certain features for non logged in users to stretch goals as we decided to focus on a logged in experience.

Key take aways:

- Our MVP allows us to focus on essential features saving time and money in the long run
- MVP also allows us to hone in on features that pertains to our target audience
- Wireframing using tools like Excalidraw helps visualise our layout, communicate our ideas, and clarify what we want to do exactly
