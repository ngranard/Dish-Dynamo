Today I worked on:
* Implementing authentication and authorization

We struggled as a team to get through implementing authentication and authorization, but with some SEIR guidance we finally got the basics working. We can now create a user, login, and see this information reflected in Beekeeper.

We learned how painful and crucial indentation is with FastAPI.

Today I worked on:
* Started authentication process for the project

As a team we began working on the authentication and authorization process for the project. We are using the jwtdown for FastAPI provided by Galvanize to secure our app.
We struggled for a little while with the documentation/instructions, but eventually got it working after realizing some variable names need to remain unchanged. We also wrote out some more necessarsy files like those in the queries and routers folder.

Tenzing helped catch some inconsistencies from the instructional video to the docs.

Today I worked on:
* Creating issues for the project in Gitlab with the entire team

As a team we decided on a structure for how our issues should look and also decided to split them up into front and back-end. We also decided to use the Gitlab issue board to track our progress in addition to Trello.

I found some references for the .yml file in Learn, which was helpful.

Today I worked on:
* Creating a .yml file for the project

I spent time alone working on the .yml file and trying to get more familiar with SQL. We also explored using Trello as a project management tool, but aren't completely sure if that's the best option for us.

John found a demo for Chakra UI, which seems like the direction we're going in for the front-end styling.

Today I worked on:
* Wireframing and MVP discussion

We spent the day working on wireframing and discussing the MVP. We've been using Excalidraw to create our wireframes. We also decided to push guest features to stretch goals and focus on the logged-in user experience.
